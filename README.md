**Author:** Jessica Jakeman

**Date Created:** 7 April, 2024

## Project Source Files

All files pertaining to this project can be found in the following GitHub repo:

- [Portfolio-Website](https://github.com/jeskaj/Portfolio-Website)

## Website Description

### Purpose

The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills, talents, abilities and coding experience, in order to introduce myself to potential employers as a skilled web developer and IT professional.

### Design

Include:  
Wireframes or mockups of the pages of your website  
Explain:  
Your decision making process relating to the overall aesthetic of your website

Mountain hero image - calming (desirable quality in a professional), reflects my love of nature

Other colours chosen to blend in with and complement the mountain hero image

### Website Structure

My portfolio has a relatively simple structure, consisting of two levels only, as shown in the sitemap below:

1. First level: Home page only
2. Second level pages:
    1. About
    2. Portfolio
    3. Blog
    4. Contact

#### Navigation

Every page contains a navigational component to enable all other pages to be accessed directly.  On the Home page, this takes the form of prominent navigational button-like anchor elements featured in the mid section of the page.  All other pages contain a nav bar, directly under the header component on smaller layouts and as a sidebar in larger layouts.

The nav bars show the link to the current page in a darker colour, to indicate the user's current location.

The About page contains a list of blog posts, which link directly to the relevant articles on the Blog page.

The only other internal document linked to the site is a PDF of my resume, which is linked to the About page.

#### External links

Links to my professional social media profiles ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessica-jakeman/) and [Github](https://github.com/jeskaj) - see screenshots below) are included in the footer of every page, except for the Contact page, which features them more prominently in the main section.
