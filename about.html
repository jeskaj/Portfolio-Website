                <h2>Hi, I'm Jessica Jakeman...</h2>
                <p>... an aspiring web developer, currently enrolled in Coder Academy's Diploma of Information Technology - Web Development (Accelerated) programme.  
                    I am excited to be moving into the field of web development and am enjoying learning HTLM, CSS, terminal commands, git and all the skills that it takes be a successful IT professional and to produce functional and responsive websites.  I look forward to learning how to code applications that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable, and that they will consequently love to use!</p>
                <p>I have over 20 years of experience in the business world, working as Administration Manager at a professional accountancy firm in Brisbane. 
                In this role, in addition to performing normal administrative functions and managing the administration team, I was the bridge between our business and IT professionals.  I provided on the ground IT support to our staff and was repsonsible for the implementation of many of our major software systems.</p>
                <p>I worked closely with our IT director to evaluate potential new software systems, with the relevant IT consultants to implement them and then set up systems and procedures to train our staff in using them efficiently and effectively.
                <p>Over the past decade, my firm transitioned to using cloud applications for all major business requirements and this process provided me with invaluable experience in understanding user needs and the ways in which software and websites can provide a streamlined and intuitive user experience - or fail to do so!</p>
                <p>During this process, our firm worked very closely with our software providers.  I provided a lot of feedback to them and got used to hearing the response, "Nobody's ever asked us that before"; my common sense and logical approach to identifying our business and user requirements and offering potential solutions to gaps in current software functionality was appreciated by our software providers and often implemented in future releases.</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>This experience has left me ideally placed to be involved in the development of websites and applications that will successfully serve business and user needs.</p>
                <p>My first jobs as a teenager were teaching violin and theory of music (I grew up playing piano and violin) and tutoring highschool maths.  I also worked as a Zumba instructor for a while in 2010 (I think my highschool HPE teachers would have fallen off their chairs in shock!) and am currently filling in teaching some ballroom dancing classes for my teacher who is overseas for a few months.</p>
                <p>My favourite hobby these days is dancing - I enjoy ballroom, latin and swing dancing and try to get out on the floor at least twice a week (as often as possible, when time allows!).  I love being out in nature, especially rainforest bushalking in the moutains (the sun is not a friend to my skin, alas) and when I just want to relax, I enjoy reading and watching movies.</p>
